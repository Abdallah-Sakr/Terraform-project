 Project Structure

The project follows a modular and maintainable structure:
- `main.tf`: Core resource definitions and logic.
- `provider.tf`: Defines the cloud provider and authentication.
- `variables.tf`: Inputs that allow customization and flexibility.
- `outputs.tf`: Outputs useful information after resource creation.
- `terraform.tfvars`: (Optional) File to store variable values securely.

This separation of concerns improves clarity and allows easy scaling of the infrastructure codebase.
